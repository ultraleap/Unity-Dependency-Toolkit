# Unity Dependency Toolkit

Tools for discovering, navigating and analysing asset dependencies.

## Installing

1. In `Edit -> Project Settings -> Package Manager`, add a new scoped registry with the following details. Scoped registry setup only needs to be performed once per Unity project.

```
Name: Ultraleap
URL: https://package.openupm.com
Scope(s): com.ultraleap
```

2. Open the Package Manager (`Window -> Package Manager`) and navigate to "My Registries" in the dropdown at the top left of the window.

3. The `Ultraleap Dependency Toolkit` package (and other Ultraleap packages) will now be available from the list to install, update or remove.

## Dependency Browser

### Features

1. Discover dependencies and references to an individual asset or folder
2. Filtering for unused (0 reference) assets
3. Filtering for missing references along with list of references to a specific missing asset
4. Lookup missing references in git repo history, recovering names for those found
5. Aggregate and navigate resource folders from all packages
6. Displays file sizes with option to sort by size
7. Supports both packages and the assets directory

### Limitations

1. Script dependency resolution is limited
   1. Does not find script asset dependencies - they can be viewed through containing .asmdef
   2. No support for dependencies/references between individual script files e.g. class references and such
2. Will not discover assets in hidden folders e.g. Samples~ in packages.
3. Missing references detection has some caveats
   1. Does not display number of references missing on a specific asset
   2. May pick up dead guids from an asset file that don't show in the inspector, indicating a non-issue
4. Will duplicate references everywhere that an asset has been copied by Unity, e.g. in scene or prefab files
   1. For example if asset A references prefab B which in turn references prefab C, asset A will show as referencing prefab C

### Usage

1. `Assets -> Generate Dependency Tree` or right click context menu `Generate Dependency Tree`.
2. This will create a `Dependency Tree` asset in the root Assets folder. You can move this anywhere - note that using Generate again will create another asset if it has been moved.
3. On the inspector of `Dependency Tree`, use the `Refresh` button to scan the project. Use this any time the project has changed to update.
4. Use `Open Dependency Browser` open and look through the results.


### Known Issues

- Dependency browser may break if it's open during recompilation. Reload the window to fix.
- Refresh may break the dependency browser if it's open. Reload the window to fix.
